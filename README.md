DAY 39

Today you have five topics to work through, in which you’ll learn about GeometryReader, ScrollView, NavigationLink, and more.




Moonshot: Introduction


In this project we’re going to build an app that lets users learn about the missions and astronauts that formed NASA’s Apollo space program. You’ll get more experience with Codable, but more importantly you’ll also work with scroll views, navigation, and much more interesting layouts.

Yes, you’ll get some practice time with List, Text, and more, but you’ll also start to solve important SwiftUI problems – how can you make an image fit its space correctly? How can we clean up code using computed properties? How can we compose smaller views into larger ones to help keep our project organized?

As always there’s lots to do, so let’s get started: create a new iOS app using the App template, naming it “Moonshot”. We’ll be using that for the project, but first lets take a closer look at the new techniques you’ll need to become familiar with…
